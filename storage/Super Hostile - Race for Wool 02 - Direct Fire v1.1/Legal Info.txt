Users are free (and encouraged) to create videos of the MAPS and share the videos online, using websites such as YouTube.  Users are also free to include advertisements and monetize their videos of my maps.  Watching people play my maps is by far the best way for me to learn how to make better maps.  If you have made video's or LP's (Let's Play series) of my maps, then thank you very much!
